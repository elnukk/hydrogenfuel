# Metal-Organic Frameworks for Safe Hydrogen Tanks

How can we use metal-organic frameworks to design safe hydrogen fuel tanks for the future of transportation?

I process data from Northwestern's MOFX to investigate the properties of metal-organic frameworks for hydrogen fuel storage. See my Meium article for details.
